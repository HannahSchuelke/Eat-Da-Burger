# Eat-Da-Burger

Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that allows users add the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever someone submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured (along with three other personal favorites).

Each burger has a button which allows it to be devoured. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the column of burgers already devoured.

Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

This was created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM, from project 11 of UMN's Coding Bootcamp.
